# jbnc
## IRC Bouncer/IRC Gateway with no authentication required written in nodejs with support for separate client buffers for playback history, an always-on connection, and SSL in and out.

## This is the missing link for IRC.

### Purpose
Bouncers are hard to configure.  I felt that we needed an easier one in this world.  This requires nearly no configuration to connect!  Just set a password!
Join #jbnc on freenode to learn more!

There are many users and networks who are stably using it today!

### Features
- Always on connection to IRC
- No registration or account required
- Separate buffers for clients
- SSL
- SASL
- Works with any RFC 1459 Compatible Client
- Password can be changed in the config and a HUP will reload the passwords.
- ***Gateway Mode for IRC Servers and Networks (See Below)***

### Compatibility
Works on:
- Freenode
- Rizon
- DALnet
- OFTC
- EFnet
- Any RFC1459 Compliant Network/Server

### Setup / Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/realrasengan/jbnc
```
2. Edit config (there are different example.confs for different use cases)
```
cp example.conf jbnc.conf
<edit> jbnc.conf
```
Values:
```
mode: gateway|bouncer
bouncerPassword: leave blank for no password
serverPort: if gateway mode, else ignored
server: if gateway mode, else eignored
webircPassword: if its there, it will try webirc authentication
webircHashIp: true or false if you want to just hide their ip but provide a hash
webircProxy: true or false if you want to pass their real ip (only matters with stunnel)
ingresswebircPassword: a password for webirc clients to use when connecting to jbnc
bouncerIp: ip you want to bind to or leave null
bouncerPort: port for bnc (do "+6697" if you want SSL (wrap in "" and put +)),
bouncerAdmin: admin pass
bouncerShack: ping ack timeout
bouncerDefaultOpmode: auto op/voice/hop mode default (can be turned on per client using /jbnc)
bouncerTimeout: how long until after no clients connected will the user stay connected
bufferMaxSize: maximum # of bytes a client buffer can hold before its terminated or 0 for unlimited
purgeReports: NumberInHours (default 48) number in hours to purge reports (logs in webadmin)
uiDefaultSaveCfg: Default config the webadmin Save Config button saves to (can only edit this here) default is "../jbnc-ui.cfg" - launch 'node bouncer.js jbnc-ui.cfg' after to use it
debug: true|false debugging on or off for dev

```

3. Run
To use the default jbnc.conf in the same folder:
```
node bouncer.js &
```

To use another config file:
```
node bouncer.js somefile.conf &
```

#### Keep it running forever (no downtime)
### immortal
To keep things running 24/7/365, there's a great app called [immortal](https://immortal.run/).

The immortaldir files are located in this repo (jbnc.yml).

Note: To use immortal on ubuntu, after following the steps on the page, please be sure to `systemctl enable immortaldir` as well as start.

### pm2
Alternatively, there's pm2. To install:
```
npm install pm2 -g
```
To prevent logs from becoming too large, simply install:
```
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
```
No configuration is needed. It works as soon as any application is launched.

To start jbnc:
```
cd /home/folder/jbnc
pm2 start bouncer.js
or sudo pm2 start bouncer.js (if using SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt directories in /etc)
```
To stop:
```
Replace "start" with "stop"
```

### IRC Client
You just need to set your password in your jbnc config and then setup your IRC client:
Just put this in your password:
```
YourServerPassword||ConnectionPasswordGoesHere/ServerGoesHere
```
To save clientbuffers for your client
```
YourServerPassword||ConnectionPasswordGoesHere/ServerGoesHere/deviceid
```

Here is an example for a desktop and mobile setup with a password protected server (password: dragon) connecting to DALnet:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/desktop
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/mobile
```

Here is an example for a desktop connecting to an irc server that is password protected and a bnc that is password protected:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667||somepassword/desktop
```

Optional: you can put the account at the end for SASL identification, ideal if the account is not the nick used:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/mobile/ArMyN
```

Your connection password gets used to attempt SASL identification.

#### SSL Client
Use "+port" to do SSL.  For example:
```
dragon||Ajdfklsjfa/irc.dal.net:+6697/mobile
```

You can also use "=port" to do SSL with a self-signed cert.
```
dragon||Ajdfklsjfa/irc.dal.net:=6697/mobile
```

#### Whilst Connected
To get a list of commands:
```
/jbnc
```

## Gateway Mode
Enable gateway mode and run on the same box as your IRCd to instantly give all your users always on connectivity and seamless synchronization across all devices.

1. Edit the config file and use gateway mode instead of bouncer.

2. Run

### Gateway Mode Setup on Client Side

If you are running jbnc on the same machine as your irc server, let's say irc.example.com, then the only difference would be that your users would need to:

1. Use a different port (8888 default for plaintext and 9998 default for SSL)

2. Enter a password in their IRC client.  They make up the password and use it to identify to their connection.
```
SomePassword/buffername
```

An example buffername could be 'desktop' and on the mobile phone could be 'mobile.'


### Web Admin Panel

A web panel for an administrator is now integrated with jbnc. It is optional.
To use it, simply install `npm install express express-session` and add the following to the jbnc.conf file:
```
  "WebAdminPanel": true,
  "WebAdminPanelPort": 8889,
  "WebAdminPanelSecret":"<a_randomly_invented_key>",
  "WebAdminPanelPassword":"<password>",
```

Then launch the web page in the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8889`. The login is `bouncerAdmin` and the password is `WebAdminPanelPassword`.

The web page is designed to be used with a proxy from nginx or httpd, by creating a subdomain like https://j-bnc.domain.com and configuring the proxy:

For nginx, something like:

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name j-bnc.domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8889;
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
And for httpd:

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName j-bnc.domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/private.key

    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8889/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8889/
    ...
</VirtualHost>
```

It is recommended to run the web page on an HTTPS-enabled site since both CDNs are HTTPS-enabled.

The web page is very basic, it displays:
- The last launch of JBNC
- The last bug of JBNC
- The number of connections (clients)
- The connected clients
- Ability to kill a user
- Ability to view the number of channels for each user
